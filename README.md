ZetaWord
========

A Notepad replacement for Windows. It's better than Notepad in some ways, worse
in others. It was originally released at http://zetacentauri.com

A compiled, installable version of ZetaWord is available in the installer directory.

ZetaWord is written using C# and .NET 2.0.  It builds and runs on Windows and
also works on Linux via Mono. A project is included for Visual Studio 11. It doesn't
have any complicated dependencies, so you can create a project for an earlier version
simply by including the source files.

Installer scripts for InnoSetup and NSIS are included, but you'll probably have to
modify the paths in order for them to work.
